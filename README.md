# Pig-GameJS
A dice game built with JS.

The object to the game is to reach 100 points first. The player looses his or her's ENTIRE points when they roll two 6's in a row 
or when a 1 is rolled after which its the next players turn. There is an input field in the game that allows users to set what the
winning score is, instead of the default 100.
